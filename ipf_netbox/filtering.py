    This function returns a function that is used to filter source_records records.

    Parameters
    ----------
    constraints:
        A list of contraint expressions that are in the form "<field-name>=<value>".

    field_names:
        A list of known field names

    include:
        When True, the filter function will match when the constraint is true,
        for example if the contraint is "os_name=eos", then it would match
        records that have os_name field euqal to "eos".

        When False, the filter function will match when the constraint is not
        true. For exampl if the constraint is "os_name=eos", then the filter
        function would match recoreds that have os_name fields not equal to
        "eos".

    Returns
    -------
    The returning filter function expects an source_records record as the single
    input parameter, and the function returns True/False on match.
